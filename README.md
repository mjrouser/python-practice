# Python Practice

I am getting back into coding after quite some time off. ECMAScript has evolved quite a lot since I made my living in ES 5/Angular 1, so to brush up on concepts and get a little deeper into the science I am diving into Python 3.

To teach myself I am using the book _Python for Everybody_. It can be found open source [here](https://www.py4e.com/book) as [part of the excellent companion website](https://www.py4e.com/). It can also be bought in print from [your local bookseller](https://www.google.com/search?q=book+store+near+me&oq=book+s&aqs=chrome.1.69i57j0i433i457i512j0i402l2j0i433i512j0i512j0i131i433i512j0i433i512j0i131i433i512j46i10i199i465i512.7620j1j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8) or [online](https://smile.amazon.com/Python-Everybody-Exploring-Data-ebook/dp/B01IA5VIFM/ref=sr_1_1?crid=JJUCIU24N96O&keywords=python+for+everybody&qid=1638133087&sprefix=python+for+ever%2Caps%2C199&sr=8-1).
